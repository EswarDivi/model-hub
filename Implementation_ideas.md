# Ideas and implementation

## Ideas

### 1. Unified Unique ID for User Details and Related Information

- After a user signs up, create a new record in the User database with a unique ID.
- Use this unique ID as a foreign key in all other related databases. This will ensure data integrity and easy retrieval of user-related data.

- Use the unique ID programmatically to retrieve and display user details. Consider creating a utility function for this to promote code reusability.

- Retrieve the username from the User database using the unique ID as a token. Ensure that this process is secure to protect user data.

- Use the Axios library to handle HTTP requests to the database. Axios is promise-based and runs on both the browser and the server (Node.js), making it a good choice for fetching data.
